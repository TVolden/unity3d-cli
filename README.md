# unity3d-cli
A tiny CLI launcher for Unity3D. Made in powershell.

## How to use

1. Just add the script to the unity project root folder.
2. Run the following command in powershell:
```powershell
unt .
``` 

Alternatively, place the script in a folder and add it to PATH.
Now you can run the `unt [path-to-unity-project-folder]` from anywhere.
